# PlaylistDataSet-Spotify-API
A program that uses the "Tekore" python library to interact with the Spotify API for retrieving data from a playlist.
This code utilizes the Tekore library to easily retrieve track data including the tracks' audio features from the Spotify API. The fetched data is then written to a CSV file to create a dataset of the chosen playlist.

To use the program, simply enter in your client_id, client_secret, and the playlistID of the playlist you want to analyze to create a dataset.
